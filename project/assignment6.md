# Learning Outcomes
By completing this assignment, you should demonstrate your ability to critically reflect on:
* Developing and validating requirements through test driven development
* Developing and validating requirements through behavior-driven development

# Assignment Details
This assignment involves writing a reflective report on your experience of the agile RE approach we used on the project, including:
- practicing test driven development
- applying behavior-driven development
- creating a software design for the back and front-ends of your app

during assignments 2, 4 and 5. This is an individual assignment. Each student must complete this assignment on their own. These questions can help guide you on what to include in the report:

## A2
* What worked well in crowd-sourcing requirements? What was frustrating?
* Did you get a sense of having found ALL of the important requirements? 
* How did the distinction between business goals and product requirements help (if at all)?
* Where was the biggest source of complexity and confusion in the assignment? 

## A4/5
* Compare your experience of developing and validating requirements using test driven development and behavior driven development?
* From your experience, what requirements are more suitable for test driven development and behavior-driven development? How?
* Which of the two would you prefer to practice on future software projects? Why?
* What problems did you face and how did you overcome those problems?
* What design improvements would you make if you had to redo the project?
* What are the ethical implications of the work you did? 
* What went well when using TDD / BDD? What went well using AI tools like Copilot?
* What lessons did you learn which you would like to apply on future software projects?

# Submission
* The report should be between 1000 to 2000 words.
* All submissions must be in PDF format. All submissions must use the letter page size, the
title should be typeset in a 24pt font and the body of the paper should be typeset in a 10-12pt

* The report must be submitted before 11:59PM on the required date. It should have a title.
In the author block, include your name, the course number and name, and the date. A single pdf file should be submitted and should be named “A6_\<uvicid\>.pdf”. All submissions should be done via the Brightspace assignment.
