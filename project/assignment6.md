# Learning Outcomes
By completing this assignment, you should demonstrate your ability to critically reflect on:
* Developing and validating requirements through test driven development
* Developing and validating requirements through behavior-driven development

# Assignment Details
This assignment involves writing a reflective report on your experience of the agile RE approach we used on the project, including:
- practicing test driven development
- applying behavior-driven development
- creating a software design for the back and front-ends of your app

during assignments 2, 4 and 5. This is an individual assignment. Each student must complete this assignment on their own. These questions can help guide you on what to include in the report:

## A2
* What worked well in crowd-sourcing requirements? What was frustrating?
* Did you get a sense of having found ALL of the important requirements? 
* How did the distinction between business goals and product requirements help (if at all)?
* Where was the biggest source of complexity and confusion in the assignment? 

## A4/5
* Compare your experience of developing and validating requirements using test driven development and behavior driven development?
* From your experience, what requirements are more suitable for test driven development and behavior-driven development? How?
* Which of the two would you prefer to practice on future software projects? Why?
* What problems did you face and how did you overcome those problems?
* What design improvements would you make if you had to redo the project?
* What are the ethical implications of the work you did? 
* What went well when using TDD / BDD? What went well using AI tools like Copilot?
* What lessons did you learn which you would like to apply on future software projects?

# Submission
* The report should be between 1000 to 2000 words.
* All submissions must be in PDF format. All submissions must use the letter page size, the
title should be typeset in a 24pt font and the body of the paper should be typeset in a 10-12pt
font.
* **Use of ChapGPT, Grammarly, etc. must be clearly labeled and cited, and restricted to grammar and structure only. You can do this by adding an appendix which explains how it was used.**
* The report must be submitted before 11:59PM on the required date. It should have a title.
In the author block, include your name, the course number and name, and the date. A single pdf file should be submitted and should be named “A6_\<uvicid\>.pdf”. All submissions should be done via the Brightspace assignment.

# Marking Criteria
* ~~A full rubric will be available on Brightspace.~~ The rubric on Brightspace is holistic and based on the [ATWP rubric](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/atwp/current-students/grading/index.php). I.e., you will be getting a letter grade mapped to a percentage. An A would receive 85%.
* The criteria can be found on that page as well; for example, **A level grades** for a paper will achieve the following:
  * Overall, the writing is clear, insightful, focused, well developed and organized, and enriched by well-chosen details and examples. It holds the reader's attention and moves the reader forward effortlessly. The writer demonstrates independent and original thinking.
  * Ideas flow logically and fluently; the thesis is clear, original, manageable, and apt; the analysis is compelling and sound. Each point is supported by at least one piece of reliable and accurate evidence. Quoted material is well integrated and correctly documented in the required style.
  * The language is precise, interesting, powerful, and engaging; sentences are well constructed, varied in length and structure, and joined by strong transitions.
  * The writer demonstrates a thorough grasp of standard English conventions (spelling, punctuation, grammar, usage, paragraphing, mechanics); there are no errors or only minor, mechanical errors.
  * The writing has many obvious strengths and no obvious need for revision.

* In particular, pay attention to the following: 
  * The report is clear, concise, well formatted, and professional
  * All required information provided in sufficient detail
  * Demonstrates critical reflection **supported by evidence** from assignments 2, 4 and 5
  * Shows the marker that the student was engaged and understood how the material in the course (e.g., requirements analysis) was reflected in the project (or not!)


# Late Submissions
No late submissions. 
If you have a legitimate reason for submitting late, discuss this with the lecturer well in advance of the assignment due date.
